# Welcome to the Galactic Empire wiki!

Galactic Empire is based on the original 1994 single-player space conquest game of the same name. The mechanics are designed to mimic the original as close as possible.

## Story

The known Galaxy is in a state of upheaval. The Galactic Council has been dissolved and all twenty member states retreat to their home planets to concentrate on their own interests. Your planet, Galactica, knows the only way to re-unify the galaxy is through military conquest of the known worlds. You only have 1200 star dates to succeed, before their governments are too far gone to respect your Empire.

## Gameplay

You control a single fleet of supply and military ships. You can collect Taxes and Military troops from your own planets, purchase Supplies, Fuel, and Ships from your planets industry.

Traveling between planets takes time, and costs Supplies and Fuel based on the distance traveled and the size of your fleet. You must attack independent planets with your fleet, then occupy them until they agree to join your empire.

All planets will produce resources based on their industry and population each star date.
